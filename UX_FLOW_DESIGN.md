# HIBR User Experience Flow Design

## Overview

This document outlines the complete user journey from form submission to investigation report, balancing educational value, trust-building, and clear monetization.

---

## üéØ Core UX Principles

1. **Educational First**: Even free tier provides real value and security education
2. **Trust Through Transparency**: Show exactly what sources were checked and why
3. **Clear Attack Classification**: Help users understand what happened to them
4. **Actionable Guidance**: Provide immediate steps and longer-term recommendations
5. **Honest Monetization**: Transparent about costs and value of premium features

---

## üì± User Journey Flow

### Stage 1: Form Submission
**Location**: `/ui/src/components/threat-analysis/ThreatAnalysisForm.tsx`

**User provides:**
- Victim wallet address
- Incident timeline and description 
- Suspected scammer information (emails, URLs, telegram handles)
- Loss amount and transaction hashes (optional)

**UX considerations:**
- Clear privacy disclaimer before submission
- Wallet address validation with helpful error messages
- Optional fields clearly marked to reduce abandonment
- Progress indicator showing "Analysis in progress..."

### Stage 2: Free Tier Analysis (0-15 seconds)
**Backend processing:**

1. **Direct Data Lookup** (`basic_threat_database.py`):
   - Check victim wallet against known compromise databases
   - Look up scammer info in cached threat intelligence
   - Cross-reference with abuse.ch, phishing blocklists

2. **AI Analysis** (`hibr_ai_service.py`):
   - Extract features from all provided indicators
   - Run through trained model for risk classification
   - Generate behavioral pattern analysis
   - Determine attack type with confidence scoring

3. **Report Generation** (`investigation_report_template.py`):
   - Classify attack type (stealer, phishing, drainer, etc.)
   - Format educational summary with immediate actions
   - Present premium investigation opportunities

### Stage 3: Report Display (Immediate)
**What the user sees:**

#### üìä AI Analysis Summary
- **Attack classification** with confidence percentage
- **Risk level** with color-coded urgency
- **Behavioral patterns** detected in their specific case
- **Technical indicators** that led to the classification

#### üîç Data Sources Checked
- **Transparent sourcing**: Show exactly what databases were queried
- **Indicator counts**: "Found 3 indicators across 2 sources"
- **Status indicators**: Clear/Low/Medium/High risk for each source
- **Educational descriptions**: What each source provides

#### üöÄ Immediate Actions (Free)
- **Attack-specific recommendations** based on classification
- **Universal security steps** (new wallet, password changes)
- **Documentation guidance** for potential legal/recovery actions
- **Timeline tracking** suggestions

### Stage 4: Premium Investigation Upsell
**Positioned as educational expansion, not sales:**

#### üí° "Enhanced Investigation Available"
- **Clear value proposition**: What additional intelligence provides
- **Transparent pricing**: $3.75 total, breakdown by source
- **Educational context**: Why these sources matter
- **Specific outcomes**: Blockchain forensics, threat attribution, recovery paths

#### üéØ Premium Sources Available:
- **VirusTotal Intelligence** ($2.50) - Multi-engine malware analysis
- **Shodan & SecurityTrails** ($1.25) - Infrastructure intelligence  
- **Blockchain Analytics** (varies) - Fund tracing and recovery opportunities
- **Threat Attribution** (included) - Link to known scammer groups

## üõ°Ô∏è Attack Type Classification System

### Stealer Malware Attack
- **Urgency**: HIGH - Change all passwords immediately
- **Common Vectors**: Fake software, malicious extensions, trojans
- **Specific Actions**: Antivirus scan, browser extension review
- **Recovery Potential**: Low (private keys compromised)

### Phishing Website Scam
- **Urgency**: HIGH - Never reuse compromised seed phrase  
- **Common Vectors**: Fake DeFi platforms, counterfeit exchanges
- **Specific Actions**: Report phishing site, check email security
- **Recovery Potential**: Low (credentials directly harvested)

### Smart Contract Drainer
- **Urgency**: HIGH - Revoke token approvals immediately
- **Common Vectors**: Fake NFT mints, malicious DeFi interactions
- **Specific Actions**: Revoke approvals, check other connected wallets
- **Recovery Potential**: Medium (if caught quickly)

### Fake Airdrop/Social Engineering
- **Urgency**: MEDIUM - Review recent transactions
- **Common Vectors**: Social media promotions, impersonator accounts  
- **Specific Actions**: Timeline documentation, screenshot evidence
- **Recovery Potential**: Varies (depends on attack sophistication)

## üí∞ Monetization Strategy

### Free Tier Value Proposition
- **Real AI analysis** using production-trained model
- **Educational attack classification** with confidence scoring
- **Immediate actionable steps** for incident response
- **Community threat intelligence** from cached sources
- **Professional-quality report** users can save/share

### Premium Tier Value Drivers
1. **Real-time intelligence** vs. cached/static data
2. **Blockchain forensics** for fund tracing
3. **Threat attribution** linking to known criminal groups
4. **Recovery opportunities** identifying potential fund recovery
5. **Law enforcement reports** with proper documentation

### Pricing Psychology
- **Cost transparency**: Show exactly what each API call costs
- **Educational framing**: "Enhanced investigation" not "premium features"
- **Value demonstration**: Specific outcomes, not vague promises
- **Pay-per-use model**: No subscriptions or hidden fees
- **Community funding**: Emphasize grants and donations supporting free tier

---

## üîí Trust and Safety Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Ephemeral processing**: No storage of user wallet addresses
- **Local AI inference**: Analysis happens without external API calls
- **Transparent data sources**: Clear attribution for all findings
- **Optional sharing**: Users control what information they provide

### Result Accuracy
- **Confidence scoring**: Always show AI confidence levels
- **Source attribution**: Link findings to specific databases
- **Disclaimer prominence**: Clear "research only" messaging
- **False positive awareness**: Acknowledge limitations of automated analysis

### Educational Responsibility  
- **Teach security hygiene**: Use incident as learning opportunity
- **Avoid victim blaming**: Focus on future protection, not past mistakes
- **Actionable guidance**: Provide specific steps, not vague advice
- **Community resource**: Position as public service, not commercial product
