## üéØ Core Mission

Democratize access to professional-grade OSINT capabilities through:
- **Automated data collection** using SpiderFoot's 234+ modules
- **Intelligent pivot sequences** following OSINT best practices
- **Form-driven workflows** reducing manual research overhead
- **Privacy-first processing** with local-first architecture
- **Research documentation** with audit trails and source attribution

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### Automated Data Collection
- **SpiderFoot Integration**: Leverage 234+ OSINT modules automatically
- **Form-Driven Intake**: Structured data collection templates
- **Intelligent Queuing**: Optimize API calls and avoid rate limits
- **Result Aggregation**: Consolidate findings from multiple sources

### Pivot Sequence Engine
- **IF-THEN-THAT Logic**: Automated decision trees for research paths
- **Domain ‚Üí Email ‚Üí Social**: Follow natural OSINT progression
- **Configurable Workflows**: Customize pivot logic for different use cases
- **Evidence Chain**: Track the path from initial seed to final findings

### Research Documentation
- **Automated Reports**: Generate comprehensive investigation summaries
- **Source Attribution**: Link every finding to its data source
- **Timeline Construction**: Chronological view of research progression
- **Export Formats**: PDF, JSON, CSV for further analysis
