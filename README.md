# Pretty Good OSINT Protocol (PGOP)

**‚ÄúNow not only the bad guys have these tools.‚Äù**

PGOP is a modular, open-source intelligence platform designed to democratize access to advanced investigative tools for journalists, researchers, activists, and public-interest technologists. It combines OSINT, blockchain forensics, and AI-powered automation into one privacy-first, accessible toolkit.

# Have I Been Rekt

**Have I Been Rekt** is a public interest, open-source crypto incident response tool designed to help users assess whether their wallet has been compromised. It provides a user- is an open-source crypto incident response tool. It helps users determine if their wallet was compromised using open-source intelligence and self-hosted AI.
