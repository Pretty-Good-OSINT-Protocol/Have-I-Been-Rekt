# Issue #4: Smart Contract Threat Analysis

## Labels
`dev-task`, `ai-training`, `estimate:8h`, `priority:high`

## Description
Implement analysis tools for detecting malicious smart contracts, honeypots, and rug pulls. Essential for DeFi-related scam detection.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Honeypot Detection
- [ ] Integrate Honeypot.is API for token scam detection
- [ ] Implement buy/sell simulation analysis
- [ ] Detect excessive transaction fees and taxes
- [ ] Identify locked liquidity and ownership issues
- [ ] Support Ethereum and BSC networks

### Token Security Analysis
- [ ] Check contract source code availability
- [ ] Analyze ownership and admin functions
- [ ] Detect proxy contracts and upgradeability
- [ ] Check for hidden mint functions
- [ ] Analyze liquidity pool security

### Rug Pull Detection
- [ ] Monitor liquidity removal patterns
- [ ] Track ownership concentration
- [ ] Detect suspicious trading patterns
- [ ] Analyze token distribution fairness
- [ ] Check for team token locks

### Contract Interaction Analysis  
- [ ] Parse transaction logs for contract calls
- [ ] Identify approval/transfer patterns
- [ ] Detect flash loan attacks
- [ ] Analyze MEV bot interactions
- [ ] Flag suspicious contract deployments

## Technical Implementation

### Honeypot Analyzer
```python
class HoneypotAnalyzer:
    def check_token(self, contract_address: str) -> HoneypotResult
    def simulate_trade(self, token: str, amount: float) -> TradeResult
    def analyze_tax_structure(self, token: str) -> TaxAnalysis
    def check_liquidity_lock(self, token: str) -> LiquidityInfo
```

### Contract Security Analyzer
```python
class ContractSecurityAnalyzer:
    def analyze_source_code(self, address: str) -> SecurityReport
    def check_ownership_functions(self, code: str) -> List[SecurityIssue]  
    def detect_proxy_patterns(self, address: str) -> ProxyInfo
    def analyze_admin_controls(self, code: str) -> AdminAnalysis
```

### Data Schema
```python
ContractAnalysis = {
    "contract_address": "0x...",
    "blockchain": "ethereum",
    "is_honeypot": True,
    "honeypot_confidence": 0.95,
    "security_issues": [
        {
            "type": "excessive_tax",
            "severity": "high", 
            "description": "99% sell tax detected",
            "evidence": "..."
        }
    ],
    "liquidity_info": {
        "locked": False,
        "lock_duration": 0,
        "removable_by_owner": True
    },
    "ownership": {
        "renounced": False,
        "owner_address": "0x...",
        "admin_functions": ["mint", "burn", "pause"]
    },
    "risk_score": 0.9,
    "analysis_date": "2024-01-01"
}
```

## Integration Points

### Blockchain Data Sources
- [ ] Etherscan/BSCScan API integration
- [ ] Web3 provider setup (Infura/Alchemy)
- [ ] Contract ABI fetching and parsing
- [ ] Transaction history analysis
- [ ] Event log parsing

### External APIs
- [ ] Honeypot.is API client
- [ ] DeFiPulse token lists
- [ ] CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap integration
- [ ] DEX aggregator APIs (1inch, Paraswap)

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Known honeypot contracts for validation
- [ ] Legitimate token contracts as control group
- [ ] Edge cases (unverified contracts, etc.)
- [ ] Performance tests for batch analysis
- [ ] API failure handling tests

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Batch processing for efficiency
- [ ] Caching of contract analysis results
- [ ] Async processing for large datasets
- [ ] Rate limiting for blockchain RPCs
- [ ] Graceful handling of network issues

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Honeypot detection working with >90% accuracy
- [ ] Security analysis covers major threat vectors
- [ ] Performance optimized for real-time analysis
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Integration with risk scoring system
- [ ] Documentation and examples provided
